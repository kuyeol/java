/**
 * This scheduler adds support to immediately re-schedule the execution of the provided task, using the provided <em>ExecutorService</em>.
 * <p>
 * It is used by <em>JWTSignatureValidator</em> to perform immediate (out of regular schedule) keys refresh upon detection
 * of unknown keys. The objective is to detect rotation of JWT signing keys on authorization server very quickly in order to
 * minimize the mismatch between valid / invalid keys on the Kafka broker and on the authorization server. Until the keys
 * are in-sync with the authorization server, the mismatch causes 'invalid token' errors for valid new tokens, and keeps
 * the Kafka broker accepting the no-longer-valid tokens.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This scheduler works in tandem with periodic keys refresh job in <em>JWTSignatureValidator</em>, using the same
 * <em>ScheduledExecutorService</em>, running the tasks on the same thread.
 * While the periodic refresh is triggered on a regular schedule, and is unaware of any other tasks, this class runs
 * the refresh task on demand as a one-off, but tries hard to succeed - it reschedules the task if it fails.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the task has already been scheduled (by calling {@link #scheduleTask()} and has not yet successfully completed,
 * another request to schedule the task will be ignored.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the scheduled task fails during its run, it will be rescheduled using the so called 'exponential backoff' delay.
 * Rather than being attempted again immediately, it will pause for an ever increasing time delay until some cutoff delay
 * is reached ({@link #cutoffIntervalSeconds}) when no further attempts are scheduled, and another {@link #scheduleTask()}
 * call can again trigger a new refresh.
 * </p>
