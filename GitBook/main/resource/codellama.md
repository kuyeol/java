1. You need to have Quarkus installed on your machine.
2. You need to have a basic understanding of Java and web development concepts.
3. Familiarity with the Quarkus framework is recommended but not required.

### Adding User Accounts in Quarkus

To add user accounts in Quarkus, you'll need to use the `quarkus-security` module. This module provides a range of features for securing your application, including support for user accounts, authentication, and authorization.

Here's an example of how to add a user account in Quarkus:

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyUserAccount implements UserAccount {
    @Override
    public String getUsername() {
        return "my-user";
    }

    @Override
    public String getPassword() {
        return "my-password";
    }
}
```

In the above example, we've defined a `MyUserAccount` class that implements the `UserAccount` interface. This class provides the username and password for the user account.

Next, we need to add the `quarkus-security` module to our `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-security</artifactId>
    <version>${quarkus.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Finally, we need to configure the `Security` section in our `application.properties` file:

```yaml
security:
  user-accounts:
    my-user:
      username: my-user
      password: my-password
```

In the above example, we've defined a `my-user` account with the specified username and password.

### Password Encryption in Quarkus

To encrypt passwords in Quarkus, you can use the `crypt` service provided by the `quarkus-security` module. The `crypt` service provides a range of encryption algorithms for securing your application's data.

Here's an example of how to encrypt a password using the `crypt` service:

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyUserAccount implements UserAccount {
    @Override
    public String getUsername() {
        return "my-user";
    }

    @Override
    public String getPassword() {
        return crypt.encrypt("my-password");
    }
}
```

In the above example, we've defined a `MyUserAccount` class that implements the `UserAccount` interface. This class provides the username and password for the user account. We've also used the `crypt.encrypt()` method to encrypt the password using the `my-password` value.

### Conclusion

In this article, we've covered how to add user accounts and password encryption in Quarkus using the popular crypt service. By following these steps, you can provide secure authentication and authorization for your web application, and ensure that your users' passwords are protected from unauthorized access.

### Step 3: Configure the Security Module

Now that we have our user account and password encryption set up, we need to configure the `Security` module in our application. This will allow us to secure our application and restrict access to authorized users only.

To configure the `Security` module, we'll need to add the following configuration to our `application.properties` file:

```yaml
security:
  user-accounts:
    my-user:
      username: my-user
      password: my-password
  authentication:
    login-page: /login
    logout-page: /logout
  authorized-routes:
    /protected-route:
      role: "my-role"
```

In the above example, we've defined a `my-user` account with the specified username and password. We've also configured the `authentication` section to use a login page at `/login`, a logout page at `/logout`, and restricted access to the `/protected-route` endpoint to users with the `my-role` role.

That's it! With these steps, you should now have user accounts and password encryption set up in your Quarkus application, and be able to restrict access to authorized users only.

### Step 4: Implement Authentication and Authorization

Now that we have our security configuration set up, we need to implement authentication and authorization in our Quarkus application. This will allow us to restrict access to certain routes and endpoints based on the user's role and permissions.

To implement authentication and authorization, we can use the `Security` API provided by Quarkus. Here's an example of how to do this:

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class MySecurity implements Security {
    @Override
    public void authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException {
        // Check if the user is logged in
        if (!authentication.getUserPrincipal().getName().equals("my-user")) {
            throw new AuthenticationException("Invalid username or password");
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void authorize(Authorization authorization) throws AuthorizationException {
        // Check if the user has the required role
        if (!authorization.getRoles().contains("my-role")) {
            throw new AuthorizationException("User does not have the required role");
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we've defined a `MySecurity` class that implements the `Security` interface. This class provides an authentication and authorization mechanism for our Quarkus application.

We've also defined two methods: `authenticate()` and `authorize()`. The `authenticate()` method is called when a user attempts to access a restricted route or endpoint, and it checks if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, it throws an `AuthenticationException`.

The `authorize()` method is called when a user attempts to access a restricted route or endpoint, and it checks if the user has the required role. If the user does not have the required role, it throws an `AuthorizationException`.

That's it! With these steps, you should now have user accounts, password encryption, and authentication and authorization set up in your Quarkus application.

Sure! Here's the next step:

### Step 5: Implement Role-Based Access Control

Now that we have our security configuration set up, we can implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain routes and endpoints based on the user's role.

To implement RBAC, we can use the `Role` and `Permission` classes provided by Quarkus. Here's an example of how to do this:

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyRole implements Role {
    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "my-role";
    }
}

@ApplicationScoped
public class MyPermission implements Permission {
    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "my-permission";
    }
}
```

In the above example, we've defined a `MyRole` class that implements the `Role` interface. This class provides a name for the role.

We've also defined a `MyPermission` class that implements the `Permission` interface. This class provides a name for the permission.

Next, we need to define the roles and permissions for our users:

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyUserAccount implements UserAccount {
    @Override
    public String getUsername() {
        return "my-user";
    }

    @Override
    public String getPassword() {
        return "my-password";
    }

    @Role("my-role")
    @Permission("my-permission")
    public void logout() {
        // Logout logic here
    }
}
```

In the above example, we've defined a `MyUserAccount` class that implements the `UserAccount` interface. This class provides the username and password for the user account, as well as the roles and permissions for the user.

That's it! With these steps, you should now have user accounts, password encryption, authentication and authorization, and role-based access control set up in your Quarkus application
